# MASTn28 Team Dynamics

## Cooperation Plan

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Angie - Design and problem-solving - 
Manuch- Logic and Control Flow
G20 - Diversity, curiosity, access to Web3
Tom - Problem-solving, Math

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
G20 is able to troubleshoot through multiple devices.  We can use our problem-solving abilities to conquer any challenges.  Through good design, logic, and control flow we should be able to create a clean project.  

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
We would like to develop competencies in merge conflicts, CSS,  and Javascript. 

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We plan to have great communication through Slack, and through daily meetings (when we all can meet).  


## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Conflict usually comes up through misunderstanding.  Listening and making sure that we all are on the same page is key to understanding.  If tensions are high we will take a break, regroup and talk it out until a resolution that suits all team members is reached.  

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We have a pretty good team with strong voices.  If someone is feeling unheard they will most likely speak up, but if not we will watch for interaction. We designate Tom as the mediator of our group to check for equal input.  

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Through compassion, empathy, and the understanding that everyone has their own strength that adds to the group.  

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
In each, mostly daily, group meeting we will check in and express any concerns to one another in a kind and helpful way.  

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
We will exhaust every possible avenue to rectify the conflict internally, but if we're unable to we’ll defer to Adam either individually or collectively.  


## Communication Plan:

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
We can message each other at any time but can be counted on to reply during class hours, with the caveat that we will check Slack at least every 12 hours.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
We will use Slack for messaging, Remo for meetings, and our phones for backup. 
 
### How often will you take breaks?
We will take breaks hourly.  Tom is our time-keeper.  

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Our plan is to have a good outline and stick with it.  If we should fall behind we’ll readjust and seek Adam’s assistance.  

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
We will communicate through Slack after hours and on the weekends.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Tom, our mediator, will be in charge of equal time.  

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We will practice inclusivity and make sure that everyone feels comfortable.  We are all on the same team with the same goals.  Plus Tom will make sure.

## Work Plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Through near-daily meetings and interactions, we will set short and long-term goals.  We will set tasks to match each person's strengths and abilities.  

### What project management tool will be used?
We are going to explore Jira and Agile, and figure out what will work best for our team.

## Git Process

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
All of our CSS, JS, and HTML files, basically our entire repository, will live on GitHub.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We’re all a part of a GitHub organization with access and permissions to our group repository.  

### What is your Git flow?
Our flow will be main, dev, and multiple feature branches as seen in class.


### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
### How many people must review a PR?
### Who merges PRs?
### How often will you merge?
### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
No, we will trust Tom to review our request with input from the team.
